Netflix Content Analysis with PySpark
Overview
This project utilizes PySpark to perform a comprehensive analysis of Netflix's content dataset. The analysis involves data filtering, handling missing values, examining categorical and temporal trends, and gaining insights into content duration. The aim is to uncover and summarize key trends in Netflix's library, such as content type distribution, regional content analysis, trends in content additions over time, and the duration characteristics of movies.

Prerequisites
Apache Spark with the PySpark library
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook or any Python-compatible IDE
Steps in the Analysis
1. Data Ingestion and Initial Exploration
The Netflix dataset (netflix_titles.csv) is loaded using PySpark's read.csv() function.
Basic exploratory steps, such as inspecting the schema and previewing rows, are performed to understand the data.
2. Data Cleaning and Preparation
Handling Missing Values: Key columns with missing data are populated with placeholders like "Uncredited," "Global," or "Untitled Content." Rows with nulls in essential fields (e.g., type, title) are removed.
Data Type Validation: Fields such as release_year are converted to integer format, and numeric values are extracted from the duration column for analysis.
3. Categorical Analysis
Analysis is conducted on categorical fields like type, country, rating, and listed_in.
This step highlights the diversity of content types, the number of distinct countries represented, and the range of ratings available on Netflix.
4. Country-wise Content Distribution
The dataset is grouped by country to calculate the number of entries per country.
The top 5 countries with the most Netflix content are identified and displayed.
5. Temporal Analysis of Content Additions
The date_added field is formatted correctly into a date (e.g., "MMMM d, yyyy").
Entries with invalid dates are filtered, and the year_added is extracted for trend analysis.
Year-wise content additions are analyzed to uncover patterns over time.
6. Movie Duration Analysis
Numeric values from the duration field are extracted and converted to integers.
The average duration of movies is calculated, providing insights into typical movie lengths on Netflix.
Insights from the Analysis
Content Type Distribution: Breakdown of different content types, regions, and ratings on Netflix.
Top 5 Countries: Identification of the leading countries based on content count.
Temporal Trends: Observations about content addition patterns over the years.
Movie Duration: Average movie length, highlighting typical viewing times for films.
How to Run the Project
Ensure Apache Spark is installed and configured.
Place the netflix_titles.csv file in the working directory.
Run the Python script in a Jupyter Notebook or an IDE with PySpark support.
Dependencies
PySpark
Pandas (optional, for additional manipulation or CSV handling)
Matplotlib (optional, for visualizations)
Conclusion
This project illustrates the power of PySpark for large-scale data analysis, using Netflix's dataset as a case study. It provides actionable insights into Netflix's content trends, additions, and movie durations, offering a deeper understanding of the platform's offerings.
